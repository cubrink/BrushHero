# Movement Data
This folder contains data we gathered from the accelerometer while moving the toothbrush. Acceleration values were captured and jerk values were calculated.

Some of the data can be viewed in graphs generated by matplotlib. These graphs were used to tell determine the threshold that should be used to determine if a brushing motion had happened.
